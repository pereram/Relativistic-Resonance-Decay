# Relativistic-Resonance-Decay

A graduate level computational physics project.Applied scientific computing concepts to implement numerical and computational methods essential in wide range of physics research disciplines. Used appropriate probability distribution functions to model resonance (unstable particles) decay in high energy physics and analyze the experimental data set for the best fit. Highest grade was awarded.
Techniques used: C++, Linux, High Energy Physics, Object Oriented Programming
